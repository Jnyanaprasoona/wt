                <li><b>Story:</b></li>
                <li>Nelakonda Bhagavanth Kesari (Balakrishna) wishes Vijaya Lakshmi, aka Viji (Sreeleela), to become strong and brave. He wants her to join the Indian Army for a solid reason. However, Viji has no interest in it. Meanwhile, Rahul Sanghvi (Arjun Rampal) pursues her for a compelling reason. What motivates his pursuit of Viji? What is the connection between Bhagavanth Kesari and Viji? Did Bhagavanth have a prior connection with Rahul Sanghvi? Did Viji join the Army? All these questions will be answered in the movie.</li>
                <li><b>Plus Points:</b></li>
                <li>After delivering two super hits, Akhanda and Veera Simha Reddy, Nandamuri Balakrishna returns with an intriguing role that is well-suited for his age, allowing him to deliver a strong performance. He seamlessly fits the character and delivers impressive mass and punch dialogues in the Telangana dialect, showcasing his exceptional dialogue delivery skills.
                    Sreeleela shines in her role as Viji, displaying decent acting skills, particularly in emotional scenes. Her participation in action sequences alongside Balakrishna adds to the film’s appeal, and her combination scenes with him are enjoyable to watch.           
                    Anil Ravipudi effectively blends mass elements with an emotional drama centered around a fatherly figure and a lady. This time, he doesn’t rely heavily on comedy, considering NBK’s stardom.</li>

                <li>Thaman, once again, demonstrates his prowess in enhancing action and emotional scenes with his powerful background score.</li>
                <li><b>Minus Points:</b></li>
                <li>The story is somewhat predictable and lacks depth. The director reveals most of the plot in the first half, leaving little room for surprises in the second half. The second half relies on flashback portions, which don’t strongly support the narrative.</li>
